      <description>I am a twelfth grade student at Vilnius Lyceum. Recently I graduated from NKKM computing school, where I spend one year learning the basics and two years the basic procedural and object-oriented programming. Here you will find some projects which I programmed during those three years. Moreover, I share here my volunteering experience. You can check out under the “Volunteering” section.

      <description>“Is it correct?” Sophie looks up at me.
“Yes, it is. Great job!”
She sings happily, doing a little dance in her seat. Looking at her, I feel like dancing too. This was one of my five years-long volunteering sessions with an organization called “KTG”, which works with schools in low-income communities to match volunteer tutors with elementary school children. That afternoon, I was the Lithuanian language tutor, but years ago I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the needed help.</description>

      <description>After acquaintance with HTML and CSS at coding school, I soon found myself leading a project related to routing tours around Vilnius for tourists. In the tenth grade, my friends and I came up with an idea of making a website that would generate the most efficient route after choosing certain historical and cultural objects while traveling around Vilnius. The uniqueness of this idea was that we did not limit ourselves to the most popular tourist spots, but extended the routes to Vilnius’ less-seen, usually underappreciated neighborhoods.</description>

      <description>Ever since I was a child, I heard from my mother that I should be careful when coming home from school. When lessons were over, I did not want to leave school. Unfortunately, the reason was not the love for school, but the fear of going home because I lived in an unsafe area. My district, where I was born and lived for 15 years, is considered one of the most unsafe in Vilnius.</description>

      <title>Planner application</title>

      <description>The idea for this application came because I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a plethora of different planning applications and I thought it would be nice to try to make my own, more comfortable for usage. I used an open-source cross-platform UI framework Xamarin and developed an application in C# programming language. Each item in a calendar can be updated individually. It is possible to change the background color, theme, the number of days, and specify the text.</description>

      <description>Through three years I&amp;rsquo;ve created a couple of video games. While the Chess and Flappy bird games I programmed using C++ language, the Memory game I programmed in C# language. Programming Flappy bird game I used the OpenGL library GLUT and its various functions, functionalities along with C++ to give an experience similar to the famous android game. It was developed in Code-Blocks.
Below you can find the code of the games.</description>

      <description>I have been volunteering at Energy and technology museum for almost a year. Growing up as a shy and self-contained person, I considered an activity that requires communication and teamwork skills very demanding for me. Picture a girl in the fourth class. When it’s her turn to speak, she is trembling so hard that the sheet in her hand shakes wildly. She rushes through her lines and falls back in relief.</description>

      <description>This application is a weather app developed using C# language. The app allows users to see the weather from their current location or another location around the globe using OpenWeather API. Using One Call API the app displays the current weather, 24 hours, and 6 days forecast. A user can add new locations and switch between them from the locations screen. From the settings screen, the unit system can be changed from metric to imperial or standard.</description>
